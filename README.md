Calculated the `average` values for the following parameters over the entire timespan covered in the data, disregarding any NaN and other non-numeric values:
   - Relative Humidity
   - Temperature Average
   - Wind Speed
   - Precipitation Amount
   - Pressure Average
     
Performed the following tasks using NumPy:
   - For each parameter, calculate the minimum, maximum, and median values.
   - Find the hour with the highest value for each parameter.
     
Created plots to visualize the trends of the following parameters over time:
   - Relative Humidity
   - Temperature Average
   - Wind Speed
   - Precipitation Amount
   - Pressure Average
